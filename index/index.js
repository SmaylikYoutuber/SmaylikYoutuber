// Hello, today I will show you how to do age verification in js.

// Characteristics:

// 1: You indicate your age and it says, “How old are you/are you?”

// 2: if the age is from 1 to 4, then it says “You are still too young!”

// 3: if the age is from 4 to 18 years, then it is written “You are not that age yet!”

// 4: If the age is from 18 to 50, then it says “You are the right age.”

// 5: If the age is more than 50 years, it is written “You are already old and do not fit in age.”

// 6: If the age is unclear or ?№*2%!”)9: it says “Unclear age!”

// Code below!?!?   ███
